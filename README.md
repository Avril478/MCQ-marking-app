Title
 A desktop application for automarking teleform results

Background
In the University of Auckland, the assessment of student performance in multiple-choice questions often involves the use of teleforms. Students complete these forms, and the examination office scans them to produce a text file containing the student responses. This text file, along with a marking rubric, is then used by course coordinators to grade the assessment.

As the text file is not provided in a common format, such as CSV, it makes it challenging for course coordinators to efficiently open and process the data using commonly used tools like Excel. To address this issue and reduce the workload for course coordinators, the project aims to develop a desktop application capable of parsing the text file provided by the examination office and automating the grading process.

Objective
The main objective of this project is to develop a desktop application that automates the marking of teleforms. The system will take student answers in a specific format provided by the examination office, along with a marking rubric, and generate grades for each student.

Target Outcomes
A MacOS (or preferably cross-platform) desktop application will be developed to parse the text file containing student answers and the rubric. The application will then compute the grades and produce a .csv file containing the results.

Student Involvement
1. Design of a user-friendly and intuitive GUI for the application, enabling efficient file upload and download operations.
2. Implementation of the following features:
- Functionality supporting the interface for uploading and downloading files.
- Parsing functionality for the text file containing student answers and the marking rubric, capable of handling common errors (such as missing answers or names).
- Functionality to compute grades and convert them into a CSV file.
